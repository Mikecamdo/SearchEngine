This program is a search engine that accepts simple Boolean queries and searches a dataset of 300,000 JSON files. The search engine is comprised of a query engine, an index handler, a document parser, and an inverted file index.

Also created and utilized a custom AVL tree class called DSAVLTree and a custom hash table class called DSHashTable.
